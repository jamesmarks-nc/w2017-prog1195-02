function handleSubmit() {
	// Expect the user to enter a name in the name text box: 
	// *** Fit all of the below into one if/else if style structure.
	// - If the user does not enter a name, 
	//   > have your application say "Hello World!"
	// - If the user just enters a number, 
	//   > have the application greet them and introduce itself as R2D2 or C3PO 
	//    (your choice) Ex: Hello 42, I'm C3PO! Nice to meet you.
	// - If the user enters YOUR first name, 
	//   > have the application respond, "Behold, the Emperess!" 
	//    (or "Behold, the Emperor" - take your pick)
	// - If the user enters any other text in the name text box, 
	//   > trim off any whitespace (look this up on w3schools) 
	//   > have the application simply output "Hello <their name>!". Ex: Hello James!
	// ! BONUS ! See if you can figure out how to determine whether the user entered 
	//           something that would be recognized by Javascript as a date. 
	//           Give them a different greeting if they did.
