// Note: index.html would have loaded department-employee.js first
  // we are going to use the arrays from that script file just like a database

// 1. Say Hello! (We'll do this together.)
// Output a welcome message for each employee in our database:
// Example:
//     Welcome to the Office Jimmi.


// 2. Information Systems Debacle: (Your turn.)
// For employees that work in the ISYS department (use deptCode)
// Output their name, title and salary.
// BONUS: Keep track of total salary and output that at the end.


// Aside... While we're at it, lets learn a **bad** way to write conditionals.


// 3. Bullets:
// Using the boilerplate code provided (in-class), change the code 
// to output a block of data about each of our departments.

// 4. Disfunctions

// 4a.
// Lets write our first "pure" function.
// if y = x + 3; Solve for y


// 4b.
// if y = mx + b, write a function that will solve for y given m, x, and b
